* JWT bearer flow is based on the token called JSON Web token (JWT).
* THe JWT token is generated by the client and signed using the private key (Note: the client system holds the private key).
* The JWT token is sent to the server for authentication, the server holds the public key and uses it to decrypt the message and validate.
* If its valid, then the system issues a access token.
* It is considered much safer as it uses Asymmetric encryption.
* Who holds the private key : The client app

Steps: 
1. Create a self signed certificate with public key and private key pairs.
2. Create a connected app in salesforce Server and upload the public key to the connected app.
3. Create an external credentials/ named credentials in the client app and upload the private key.
4. Try authenticating using the JWT flow from the client org to the server org.
