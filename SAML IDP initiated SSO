IDP initiated sso is usually not recommended as due to the following security issue. 

* Lack of context because the SP receives an unsolicited SAML response. 
* SP is forced to rely solely on the assertion timestamp which is less reliable. 

A real world example to understand this better. 
SP Initiated SSO --> Somebody comes to the office door and they are sent to security office to get the pass and come back. 
IDP initiated SSO --> somebody directly goes from security office with a pass.
