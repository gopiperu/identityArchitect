IDP initiated sso is usually not recommended as due to the following security issue. 

* Lack of context because the SP receives an unsolicited SAML response. 
* SP is forced to rely solely on the assertion timestamp which is less reliable. 

A real world example to understand this better. 
SP Initiated SSO --> Somebody comes to the office door and they are sent to security office to get the pass and come back. 
IDP initiated SSO --> somebody directly goes from security office with a pass.

* In the connected app of the IPD's connected app, you will have a url for IDP- initiated Login URL : for 
example https://resilient-wolf-2mwje1-dev-ed.trailblaze.my.salesforce-setup.com/one/one.app#/alohaRedirect/https://resilient-wolf-2mwje1-dev-ed.trailblaze.my.salesforce.com/idp/login?app=0spaj0000002h8v&isdtp=p1
