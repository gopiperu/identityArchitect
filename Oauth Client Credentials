How I think it works. 


1. The target server has a connected app with client id and client secret created.
2. The source server initiates oauth client credentials auth request to the target server by sending the client Id and secret. ( the named credential does it implicitly)
3. the target server will validate the client id and secret and issue an access token in response.
