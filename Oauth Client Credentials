How I think it works. 


1. The target server has a connected app with client id and client secret created. The source org will have an external credentials and named credentials with the client id and secret of the target org connected app.
2. The source server initiates oauth client credentials auth request to the target server by sending the client Id and secret. ( the named credential does it implicitly)
3. the target server will validate the client id and secret and issue an access token in response. 


External credential usually deals with making the authentication. Soi that should contain the Identity provider url. 
Once the identity is received. We can make callout to N number of services offered by the authentication. 
For example lets say we have a mulesoft services but in order make a callout to that mulesoft service we need to authenticate with Azure IDP. 
In this case External credentials will have the url to Azure IDP and Named credentials will have the url of the mulesoft service in specific. 


External App Policy.
1. All users can authorize : Wide open. anybody can use the connected app/. 
2. Admin approved user can self authorize : Only users with certain profile can use the connected app to authenticate. 


Sample code from the source org. 

HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();
req.setEndPoint('callout:ClientCredNamed/services/data/v59.0/query/?q=SELECT+NAME+FROM+Account');
req.setMethod('GET');
HttpResponse res = new Http().send(req);
if(res.getStatusCode() == 200)
{
    String resBody = res.getBody();
    system.debug('available accoutns'+resBody);
}
else
{
    System.debug('callout failed with status code'+res.getStatusCode());
}
