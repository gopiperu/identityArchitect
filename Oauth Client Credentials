How I think it works. 


1. The target server has a connected app with client id and client secret created. The source org will have an external credentials and named credentials with the client id and secret of the target org connected app.
2. The source server initiates oauth client credentials auth request to the target server by sending the client Id and secret. ( the named credential does it implicitly)
3. the target server will validate the client id and secret and issue an access token in response.
