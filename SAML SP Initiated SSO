SAML SP initiated SSO is the most common scenario for implementing SSO for most clients. 
* SAML has been around for a long time. 
* SAML assertion is XML based. 
* Not very great for Mobile apps, Saas applications. but used mostly in enterprise / government systems. 

*******************************
High level flow: 

1. SP has a button in the login page ( login with IDP) that triggers the initiation of SSO. 
  * SP initiates a SSO request based on the details configured in SP. 
  * SP uses a ACS url to send the request. 
2. IDP receives the SSO Request and checks if the given a user session is already active ( How ?? are we sending a unique identifier). Not very sure about that.
3. IDP displays the login page for the user to enter username and password ( SP is completely not aware of the username/password entered by the user). 
4. IDP authenticates the user and if the username and password is valid. 
  * Then, it creates a SAML assertion with the status ( success), Federated Identifier ( username, email or corporate Id), signs it with a private key ( to make sure the message is not tampered with).
5. SP receives the SAML assertion and its time for the SP to validate the SAML assertion message. 
6. SP user the public key to validate the SAML assertion message.
  * This process uses asymmetric encryption. 
  * From SP end , SP uses the public key ( added at the time of setting up single sign based on saml metadata from IDP) and creates a HASH based on the public key it has and compares with the details provided in the SAML assertion. 
  * if the has wont match then it means somebody tried to tamper the data in the middle and will be rejected by the SP. 
  * it also checks for the expiry date/time of the SAML assertion and in case if its expired then also it will be rejected. 
7. if the Hash matches and not expired then authentication will be completed at SP side and session token issued.
