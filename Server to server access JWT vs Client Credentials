* There are two main flows( using Oauth) that enables server to server flow in salesforce. 
  1. JWT bearer flow
  2. Client Credentials flow

  2 Key distinction between these two flows.

  1. User context : There is a way to maintain user context in JWT flow as the sub value in the JWT claim contains the user information that will make sure 
  the access granted using this flow is capable of running only in the context of the user. whereas in Client credentials flow. it relies on the principal attached to the 
  connected app. 
  2. Certificate based authentication: JWT uses certificate based authentication which is considered more secure as it uses public key and private key combination wherears Client credential flow works 
  based on secret( private key in other words).
